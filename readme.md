# HOW TO CONTRIBUTE

Start by forking the repository.

A little to understand before moving on is that, this bot is designed to speak english and swahili separately.
Therefore, intents are divide into two; swahili intents and english intents.
Intents have a naming convention which is:

- Append `sw_` to an intent name to mean its swahili version.

Add your contributions to the data directory, in the flows.yaml / intents.yaml. Then make a pull request.
After your pull request is closed, the updates you made will be published to the bot directly using github actions.

Fix some typos add some missing flows and intents. Let us make it better.

Happy codding!!!
