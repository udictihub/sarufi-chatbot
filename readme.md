# HOW TO CONTRIBUTE

fork the repository.

A litle to understand before moving on is that, this bot is designed to speak english and swahili separately.
Therefore, intents are divide into two; swahili intents and english intents.
Intents have a naming convetion which is:

- Append `sw_` to an intent name to mean its swahili version.

Add your contributions to the data directory, in the flows.yaml / intents.yaml. Then make a pull request.

Fix some typos add some mid=ssing flows and intents. Lets make it better. 

Happy codding!!!
